These are the test cases we used to test our code.  You can run them by running make and then ./testfiles/test1  etc.


test1.c
Basic check that our code works.  It mallocs and free()s a pointer.

test2.c
Check then when something is malloc'd and free()d, and then we call malloc again, that it uses the same memory block. (the one that was just free()d).

test3.c
A more complicated version of test2.

test4.c
Tests that we correctly handle free()ing a pointer that is already free().

test5.c
Tests free()ing pointers to dynamic memory that were not returned from malloc()

test6.c
Tests free()ing pointers that were never allocated.

test7.c
Attempt to reach Saturation and correctly error out.
